I'm a PhD student in the Business Economics program at Harvard Business School. 

Before my PhD, I worked as a research assistant at [Opportunity Insights], where I studied economic mobility using large administrative datasets. 

I graduated from Harvard College in 2023 with an A.B. in Applied Mathematics and an A.M. in Statistics. While there, I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jesse Shapiro], under whom I studied zoning regulation related to accessory dwelling units in my [senior thesis]. My work won the [Dunlop prize], awarded to the "best thesis [...] at the interface of business and government."
