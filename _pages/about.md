I am a research assistant at [Opportunity Insights], where I work on questions of economic mobility and public policy. In May 2023, I graduated from Harvard with a B.A. in Applied Mathematics/Economics and an M.A. in Statistics. While there, I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jesse Shapiro]. On this site, you can find my academic research, other projects, and miscellaneous writing.
