I am a research assistant at [Opportunity Insights], where I work on questions of economic mobility and public policy using large administrative datasets.  

I graduated from Harvard in May 2023 with a B.A. in Applied Mathematics/Economics and an M.A. in Statistics. While there, I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jesse Shapiro], under whom I studied zoning regulation related to accessory dwelling units in my [senior thesis]. 

On this site, you can find my academic research, other projects, and miscellaneous writing.
